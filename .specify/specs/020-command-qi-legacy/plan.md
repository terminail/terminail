# Implementation Plan: QI Command

**Branch**: `015-qi-command` | **Date**: 2025-11-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/015-qi-command/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements the `qi` command for the TerminAI terminal interface, allowing users to ask questions to the currently selected AI service. When a user executes `qi <question>`, the TerminAI extension communicates with the Playwright MCP server running in a Podman container to send the question to the AI chat website and retrieve the response. The response is then displayed in the terminal in real-time as it is generated by the AI service.

The implementation involves parsing the `qi` command and its parameters, validating the question content, sending the question to the MCP server, and handling the streaming response from the AI service. The command provides immediate feedback to the user about the question submission and displays the AI response as it arrives.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Node.js 18+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code Extension API, TerminAI Terminal components, MCP Client  
**Storage**: In-memory question/response handling, configuration in `.terminai` directory  
**Testing**: Mocha/Chai for unit tests, manual testing for integration  
**Target Platform**: VS Code extension running on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
**Project Type**: Single project (VS Code extension)  
**Performance Goals**: Question submission < 200ms, response display < 100ms  
**Constraints**: Requires active MCP server connection, valid AI service context  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, single question execution at a time

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the project constitution, this feature complies with all guidelines:
- Uses TypeScript as primary language
- Follows VS Code extension development patterns
- Integrates with existing TerminAI terminal architecture
- Maintains security by running locally without external dependencies
- Follows established testing practices

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure as this is a VS Code extension with integrated components. The command implementation is organized in a dedicated commands directory to separate command logic from core terminal functionality.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No constitutional violations identified. The feature follows established patterns for VS Code extensions and integrates properly with the existing TerminAI terminal architecture.
