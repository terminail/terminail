# Feature Specification: QI Command

**Feature Branch**: `015-qi-command`  
**Created**: 2025-11-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The 'qi' command allows users to ask questions to the currently selected AI service, as described in terminail.md line 2244-2245."

## Implementation Summary

This feature implements the `qi` command for the Terminail terminal interface, allowing users to ask questions to the currently selected AI service. When a user executes `qi <question>`, the Terminail extension communicates with the Playwright MCP server running in a Podman container to send the question to the AI chat website and retrieve the response. The response is then displayed in the terminal in real-time as it is generated by the AI service.

The implementation involves parsing the `qi` command and its parameters, validating the question content, sending the question to the MCP server, and handling the streaming response from the AI service. The command provides immediate feedback to the user about the question submission and displays the AI response as it arrives.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ask Questions to AI Service (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Terminail, I want to use the `qi` command to ask questions to the currently selected AI service so that I can get answers directly in the terminal interface.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the Terminail extension.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending questions and verifying that responses are received and displayed in the terminal.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with a ready terminal and selected AI service, **When** they type "qi <question>", **Then** the MCP server should send the question to the AI website and display the response in the terminal.
2. **Given** a user with a ready terminal, **When** they send a question and the AI is generating a response, **Then** the terminal should show progress indicators or partial responses as they arrive.
3. **Given** a user with a ready terminal, **When** they send a question to an AI service that is not responding, **Then** the terminal should show appropriate timeout or error messages.

### User Story 2 - Command Feedback and Validation (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Terminail, I want immediate feedback when I use the `qi` command so that I know whether the question was submitted successfully.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for providing a responsive user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the `qi` command and verifying appropriate feedback is provided.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user executing a valid `qi` command, **When** the command completes, **Then** the terminal should display confirmation of the question submission.
2. **Given** a user executing an invalid `qi` command (empty question), **When** the command fails, **Then** the terminal should display an appropriate error message.
3. **Given** a user executing `qi` without parameters, **When** the command is processed, **Then** the terminal should display usage information.

### User Story 3 - Real-time Response Display (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Terminail, I want to see AI responses displayed in real-time as they are generated so that I can monitor the progress of long-running responses.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for providing a responsive interaction with AI services.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending questions that generate streaming responses and verifying real-time display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sending a question that generates a long response, **When** the AI is generating the response, **Then** the terminal should display partial responses as they arrive.
2. **Given** a user with a streaming response, **When** new content is received, **Then** it should be appended to the existing output without delay.
3. **Given** a user with a completed response, **When** the AI finishes, **Then** the terminal should indicate the response is complete.

### User Story 4 - Error Handling and Timeouts (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Terminail, I want clear error messages when questions fail or timeout so that I can understand and resolve issues.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for providing a good user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various error conditions and verifying error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sending a question to an unavailable AI service, **When** the service doesn't respond, **Then** the terminal should display a timeout error message.
2. **Given** a user with a network issue, **When** the connection fails, **Then** the terminal should display an appropriate error message.
3. **Given** a user sending a question that results in an AI service error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the terminal should display the error information.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user provides an empty question?
- How does the system handle questions with special characters or Unicode?
- What happens when the MCP server is not responding during question submission?
- How does the system handle very long questions that exceed reasonable limits?
- What happens when the user tries to send a question while another question is being processed?
